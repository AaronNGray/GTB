Visual Studio 2015 32bit and 64 bit Ports
This is the distribution for GTB V2.51 dated 21 September 2006

0. Pre-built executables.

The Unix distribution contains a pre-built executable called gtb that
runs under Linux.

The Windows distribution contains a pre-built executable called
gtb_cygwin.exe that runs under cygwin on Windows (a Unix emulation
environment) and another called gtb_xp.exe which runs under plain
Windows-XP.

1. To build under Linux, Cygwin on Windows or other systems with the
GNU g++ compiler and GNU make installed: type make in this directory.

2. To build on other systems

If you are running on a non-Linux system, you should be able to
achieve the same result by typing

   my_cpp -I src/gtb -I src/gtb_lib -o gtb src/gtb/*.cpp src/gtb_lib/*.cpp

where my_cpp is substituted with the name of your C++ compiler in the
command above. This certainly works for bcc32, the Borland V5.1
compiler that we use for development, and got g++.

3. Compiler warnings

GTB should compile without warnings on the standard settings. 

There are instances of unused code, paramaters and variables that will
generate warnings if the g++ -Wall option is used.

4. Known problems

GTB assumes that pointers and integers are the same size. On some
64-bit architectures (DEC/Compaq Alpha) this assumption is not
valid. g++ will issue warnings in such cases.

5. Using GTB

Once built, we suggest that you start with the short introduction
manual gtb_brief.pdf. People who are unfamiliar with parsing
algorithms might prefer to work through the detailed tutorial manual
gtb_tut.pdf which makes use of gtb scripts in directories tut_ex and
lib_ex.

6. Visualising output

GTB can output graphs suitable for display with the VCG and AiSEE
tools. We strongly recommend that you acquire one of these tools.

A. VCG is available for free under the terms of the GPL from 

     http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~sander/html/gsvcg1.html

You can also collect the two distribution files from our FTP server

     ftp://ftp.cs.rhul.ac.uk/pub/rdp

Download vcg_p1.zip and vcg_p2.zip. Installation is straightforward:
simply unzip both files into a directory of your choice and run the
executable vcg.exe directly.


B. AISee is a commercial tool developed from VCG: it is free for academic use but you need to register: see http://www.aisee.com/ 

AISee is more stable than VCG and has some new features. We recommend it.


7. Source code

The source code lives in two directories: src/gtb_lib contains the
library which is common to GTB and some of the other tools developed
here, and src/gtb contains the modules which are specific to
GTB. Together they make just over 22,000 lines of code: happy reading!
